  <h1>Brave's Affiliate Scandal</h1>
  <p class="date"><em><time datetime="2021-12-30">Last edited: December 30th, 2021</time></em></p>
  <p>Friends have been asking me to give my opinion on this, but I have resisted. The reason was, I was biased and believed Brave deserved another chance, stood up for them, more importatly, I had been using Brave for quite some time. This incident took place in June 2020, and I'm writing about it, when 2022 is just about to start, I know, but I needed time to share my opinion on this, and as I'm a 9th grade student, these topics are secondary for me. But for those who don't know about this incident, I'll be starting from the start.</p>
  <h2>The Scandal</h2>
  <p>The story starts on June 6, 2020, when <a href = "https://twitter.com/cryptonator1337">a Twitter user</a> <a href = "https://twitter.com/cryptonator1337/status/1269201480105578496">spotted</a> Brave was autocompleting to "https://binance.us/en?ref=35089877", when he was trying to access "https://binance.us", the link which Brave autocompleted was an affiliate link from which Brave would earn commission, but it could also be used to track users. The Twitter user <a href = "https://twitter.com/cryptonator1337/status/1269202426202128385">confirmed</a> this worked for binance.com as well. Another Twitter user <a href = "https://twitter.com/lawmaster/status/1269321803815673856">showed</a> that this worked for other sites like Conibase, Ledger and Trezor as well, and redirected users to the links which Brave profited from.  </p>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So when you are using the <a href="https://twitter.com/brave?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@brave</a> browser and type in &quot;binance[.]us&quot; you end up getting redirected to &quot;binance[.]us/en?ref=35089877&quot; - I see what you did there mates ðŸ˜‚</p>&mdash; xCR1337 (@cryptonator1337) <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptonator1337/status/1269201480105578496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 6, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  <p>In no time, Brave was trolled at Twitter, Reddit communities, Hacker News, in their GitHub's repositories and countless other plaforms and independent websites. The developers of Brave fixed this issue on the same date, and their co-founder and CEO Brendan Eich publicly apologized on the very same date in a series of tweets. In one tweet, he explain the reason behinf these links as "With Brave, we're trying to build a viable business that puts users first by aligning interests via private ads that pay user >= what we make on fixed fee schedule, no browser data in the clear on any of our servers, and so on. But we seek skin-in-game affiliate revenue too".</p>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">5/ The autocomplete default was inspired by search query clientid attribution that all browsers do, but unlike keyword queries, a typed-in URL should go to the domain named, without any additions. Sorry for this mistake â€” we are clearly not perfect, but we correct course quickly.</p>&mdash; BrendanEich (@BrendanEich) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrendanEich/status/1269317625915400192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 6, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>  <h2>My Opinion</h2>
  <p>Although, some time has passed after this incident took place, however people still remember this and privacy communities don't recommend Brave due to the event. This is not the only controversy which Brave has had, according to Wikipedia, Brave has had three other <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_(web_browser)#Controversies">controversies</a>. More over, I am no longer using Brave. I understand link hijacking wasn't expected from a browser maker, which has privacy as its first priority. But I still believe Brave deserves another chance, but it's no doubt that this incident has put up an everlasting stain on Brave's image, which just can't go. </p> <br>
